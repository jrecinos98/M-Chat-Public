# M'Chat Android Messaging

- **Description** 

An Android, end-to-end encryption messaging application that allows users to send text and multimedia messages through Wi-Fi/LTE. It is a privacy and security centered messaging app.

End-to-end encryption is ensured through the use of public key encryption. Each user had their own public and private key pair that are used to decrypt messages received from others (private key) and to encrypt messages oncoming messages (public key). This ensures that only the destination user will get access to the messages. To enforce privacy,a user does not need to provide a phone number or name to sign up. As long as they have an email account they can utilize the app. Furthermore, messages are not permanently stored in the cloud and instead thy are stored on the user's device. This way there is no data about the users in a database that can be exploited.

Currently M'Chat supports sending text messages and images over the network. It does not rely on a data plan as all messages are IP packets. Voice over IP (VoIP) is in the pipeline and will be added in time.
